## Usage
1. Place down a regular wooden barrel
2. Open the barrel, and in its exact center place any amount of TNT
3. Place a single gunpowder in the slots one to the left and one to the right of the TNT
4. Place any modifier items in the slots one above and one below the TNT
5. Close the menu, and either attack the barrel or set down some fire next to it

The power of the explosion will scale with the amount of TNT you place in the center of the barrel. (1 to 64)

Currently accepted modifier items are:
* Splash Potions: Splash down a potion effect around the blast radius
* Lingering Potions: Same as splash potions, but the effect sticks around for 30 seconds
* Firework Rockets: Shoot out a firework from the center of the explosion
